# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python
For this project I have use Cars dataset from kaggle with features including make, model, year, engine, and other properties of the car.

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.Here I have used a few major steps to complete this project:
1. Getting description of the dataset.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Visualizing Data.
4. Handling Outliers.
